// 4. Now secondFunction() will execute the `secondFunctionCallback()` which is nothing but the callback function(anonymous function) which we have passed as a parameter.
// 5. Then thirdFunction() will be executed.
// and likewise it will work for executing the fourthFunction(), fifthFunction().

// Here we have a many nested callbacks inside a callback.
// it becomes difficult to read and pass callbacks.
// Callback functions are useful for short asynchronous operations about two to three nested callbacks but not for more.
// By nesting callbacks in such a way, we easily end up with errors, hard to read, and hard to maintain code
// This pattern is nothing but the CALLBACK HELL.
